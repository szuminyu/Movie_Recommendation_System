# Movie_Recommendation_System<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In this project, I try three types of recommendation engines for movies from the Full MovieLens Dataset, which includes meta_data and ratings datasets. The datasets can be found on <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/rounakbanik/the-movies-dataset" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">Kaggle</a>.</p>

<p> The first dataset I use, meta_data, contains 45000 movies. I analyze it for the selection of top movies and content-based filtering system. I build a collaborative filtering engine using the second dataset, ratings, which I only analyze 20000 rows because of the limitation of my laptop.</p>
